Hello guys

I'm new to technology, micro entrepreneur, putting a lot of effort into learning about new technologies and how they can help me. 

To give you an idea, I discovered ChatGPT from children's mouths, I was curious, I went to investigate and discovered the powerful information tool.

I haven't figured out how to automate anything yet. Extracting contacts from Linkedin I'm already managing to do, but everyone I've used has not yet completely convinced. 

I appreciate any help. I need to differentiate myself from the Competition. 

I participate in auctions of materials and equipment and also bids in Brazil. 

I'm putting together a kit of products and services for Brazilian Agribusiness. Finding good partners abroad would help me sell something that is in high demand in this sector.

I hope to be able to contribute in some way as well. 

Thank you in advance
